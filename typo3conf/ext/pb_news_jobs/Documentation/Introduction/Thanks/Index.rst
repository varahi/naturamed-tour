Say thank you
----------------

I love the idea of Open Source.
TYPO3 and its community has given a lot to me, so I'm happy to give something back.

Nevertheless I have spent a lot of work and hours in developing my extensions. (https://extensions.typo3.org/?L=0&id=1&tx_solr%5Bq%5D=peter+benke)

So, if you would like to say thank you, don't hesitate to support me with a little donation ;-)
